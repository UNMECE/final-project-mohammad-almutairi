Description:

I this program we simulated water distribution among the regions by using canals. 
The code take decision where to send water on the basis of need of region and status like drough and it monitor surplus and capacity
for effectiveness.

 
 Files:

    StudentSolution.cpp â€“ we edited this file

    README.txt  This file

 Key Logic:

    Regions are scanned on hourly basis.

    we computed needs and surplus.

    For water transfer canals are toggled open.

    Simulation keep running until all regions are satisfied or time runs out.

 Note:

I have submitted the separate report file via portal.
